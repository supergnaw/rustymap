Render Minecraft Maps

## This is a learning project

This project is primarily a learning tool for me to learn [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). I mostly work with other languages, such as PHP, Python, and JavaScript, all of which were self-taught. I learn through immersion, and this project is an example of this. The following are my goals and how I intend to meet them:

### Learning goals

#### Proper Syntax
You can't have a working codebase if the syntax is wrong!

#### Variables, Types, and Data Structures
Minecraft NBT data provides ample opportunity to learn how to convert data between different types, parse data from raw bytes, and much more.

#### File Input/Output
This will be part of the process of reading data from the Minecraft files in raw format to parse as NBT data, as well as manipulating and saving image data back onto the filesystem.
